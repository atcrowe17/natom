interface_selector.py - Given a Cisco IOS-XE/IOS-XR config file, builds a dictionary which defines Cisco IOS-XE and IOS-XR interfaces based on their type (L2, L3, Tunnel, or Loopback). The dictionary is used to create configurations based on the defined interface type.

Example Use Case: Use interface_selector.py to build Cisco IOS-XE/XR interface configurations for Ansible Playbooks.
